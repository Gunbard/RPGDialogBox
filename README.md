# RPGDialogBox
It's literally a dialog box from some RPG

![Sample, totally real world dialog](/readme-img/sample.gif)

See/use it live here: https://gunbard.github.io/RPGDialogBox/

### Features
- Typewriter-style text with automatic word-based line breaks (so a word doesn't move to a new line while it's being typed)
- Page breaks
- Auto close and re-open (like if a new character starts talking)
- Auto page advancing
- Custom background and dialog box colors (for color keying, etc.)
- Quick text input control to immediately show dialog (for chatting, etc.)
- Written in vanilla ES6 JS

### Running
- Download repo zip or from latest releases
- Open index.html in a browser (tested in Firefox 86+ and Chrome 90+)
- That's it
- Extra: Key out dialog box in some broadcasting software!
